\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
    
We re-examine the 1987 paper by Joan Lucas\cite{lucas1987rotation}, who showed that the edge-flip graph of convex polygon triangulations is Hamiltonian.  We focus specifically on the first part of her paper on Hamiltonian paths, and we provide a simplified algorithm for that case which elucidates how to assemble a recursive subdivision that she refers to as ``stacks.''  Finally, we provide an interactive web-based visualization of Hamiltonian paths through the stacks.

\section{Convex Flip Graphs}

A \textbf{flip graph} for the triangulation of a particular polygon has a vertex for each possible triangulation, and an edge between two vertices if their corresponding triangulations differ by a single \textbf{quadrilateral edge flip}.  In the special case of convex polygon with $n+2$ vertices, the flip graph can be realized as the 1-skeleton of a convex polytope known as the \textbf{associahedron $K_n$} (Figure~\ref{fig:associahedron}).  This polytope has ``Catalan number'' $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$ vertices, each of whose $i^{\text{th}}$ coordinate in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$ is the total area of all triangles adjecent to vertex $i$ \footnote{Though this embedding is in $n+2$ dimensions, the geometry can be embedded in $n-1$ dimensions.}.

Furthermore, since there is a bijection between the triangulations and all possible rooted binary search trees with $n$ internal nodes and $n+1$ leaf nodes, the flip graph is also called the ``rotation graph''  \cite{lucas1987rotation} (Figure~\ref{fig:correspondences}).  In this context, an edge in $K_n$ corresponds to a single {\bf tree rotation}.  Thus, a Hamiltonian path through this structure also gives a way to traverse all possible binary trees with $n$ internal nodes via a single tree rotation at each step.

\section{Enumerating And Visualizing A Hamiltonian Path}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{elevengon.pdf}
    \caption{Construct a triangulation from a valid codeword starting at the end and working back in a counter-clockwise fashion, adding $w[i]$ edges to the closest visible vertices at $j > i+1$.  Upon completion, extract the corresponding binary tree by putting an internal node in each triangle and connecting nodes belonging to adjacent triangles.  Leaf nodes are on the boundary edges of the polygon.  An edge flip in a quad decrements one entry of $w$ and increments another.}
    \label{fig:construct}
\end{figure}

Remarkably, as Joan Lucas shows in her 1987 paper \cite{lucas1987rotation}, the flip graph is Hamiltonian.  To show this, she uses \textbf{codeword encodings} of triangulations introduced by Zerling \cite{zerling1985generating} to design an $O(C_n)$ time algorithm for enumerating Hamiltonian paths and cycles.  Specifically, the $i^{\text{th}}$ entry of a codeword $w$ counts the number of internal edges incident on vertex $i$ that connect to a vertex with a greater index, where $w[0]$ corresponds to the left of the top edge.  As such, each internal edge contributes to exactly one entry.  As Lucas proves \cite{lucas1987rotation}, a codeword is a valid representation of a convex polygon triangulation if and only if:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:valid1}
    \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} w[i] = n-1
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:valid2}
    w[i] \leq n - i - \sum_{k=i+1}^{n-1} w[k], 0 < i < n
\end{equation}



The first condition follows since triangulations of polygons with $n+2$ vertices have exactly $n-1$ internal edges, and the second condition prevents internal edge crossings.   Given a valid codeword, one can construct the corresponding triangulation by starting at vertex $i-1$ and moving backwards one vertex at a time to vertex $0$, adding $w[i]$ internal edges at each step to the closest visible vertices with indices $> i+1$ (Figure~\ref{fig:construct}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{RotationExamples.pdf}
    \caption{All of the above examples increment one entry and decrement a different entry to move from $w_1$ to $w_2$, but not all describe a single valid edge flip in a quadrilateral.}
    \label{fig:rotexamples}
\end{figure}


A necessary condition for a single edge flip between codewords $w_1$ and $w_2$ is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rot1}
    w_1[a] = w_2[b] \pm 1, w_2[b] = w_1[a] \mp 1, a < b \text{, and }  w_1[k] = w_2[k], k \notin \{a, b\}
\end{equation}

Intuitively, the vertices at indices $a, b$ are the base of a quadrilateral where an edge flip happens, and they exchange exactly one edge.  However, this is not sufficient; the quad should also be free of other internal edges, and the polygonal region below $ab$ should be fully triangulated.  Formally, the following two additional conditions are sufficient (\cite{lucas1987rotation} lemma 2):

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rot2}
    \sum_{\ell = k}^{b-1}  w_1[\ell] < b-k, a < k < b
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rot3}
    \sum_{\ell = a}^{b-1} w_1[\ell] \geq (b - a) + \delta_{w_1[a]+1, w_2[a]} - \delta_{a,0} \text{,  where }  \delta_{x,y} = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & x = y \\ 0 & x \neq y \end{array} \right\}
\end{equation}

The first Kronecker $\delta$ case accounts for an edge flip moving a diagonal out of $a$, and the second $\delta$ accounts for the top boundary edge which may be edge $ad$ of the quad $abcd$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Extreme.pdf}
    \caption{A $d$-extreme codeword remains $d$-extreme after an edge flip involving index $d+1$.}
    \label{fig:extreme}
\end{figure}

A codeword $w$ is in {\bf $d$-extreme}, $1 \leq d \leq n-1$, if $w[i] = 0$ or $w[i] = n-i-\sum_{k=i+1}^{n-1} w[k]$ for all $1 \leq i \leq d$.  Lucas proves that if an edge flip is possible using index $d+1$ in a $d$-extreme codeword $w_1$, then the resulting codeword $w_2$ is also $d$-extreme (Figure~\ref{fig:extreme}, lemma 3 in \cite{lucas1987rotation}).


Finally, Lucas defines a {\bf $d$-dimensional stack} as the set of valid codewords that share the last $n-d-1$ entries.  ``Dimension'' is apt here, as such a codeword has $d$ degrees of freedom; there are $d+1$ unspecified entries, but $w[0]$ is linearly dependent on the rest given Equation~\ref{eq:valid1}.  Furthermore, define the {\bf height $h$ of a stack} as the number of possible entries $w[d]$ can take on in a particular $d$-dimensional stack $S$.  Based on Equation~\ref{eq:valid2}, this is

\begin{equation}
    h = \left(n-d-\sum_{k=d+1}^{n-1} w[k]\right) + 1
\end{equation}


\begin{figure}
    \begin{python}
def make_stack_rec(w, d, stack_index, wsum): 
    n = len(w)
    h = n-d-wsum+1 # where wsum = sum(w[d+1:])
    vals = list(range(h)) # Entry in w[d] for each substack
    if stack_index[d]%2 == 1: # Reverse every other d-dim substack
        vals = reversed(vals)
    stack_index[d] += 1
    for val in vals:
        w[d] = val
        if d == 1: ## Base case
            w[0] = n-1-(w[d]+wsum) # Equation 1 re-arranged
            print(w) # This will print the codewords in Hamiltonian order
        else:
            make_stack_rec(w, d-1, stack_index, wsum+val)
def print_hamiltonian(n): # Print a Hamiltonian traversal of Kn
    make_stack_rec([0]*n, n-1, [0]*n, 0) # Start on an (n-1)-extreme node
        \end{python}

\end{figure}

We now sketch Lucas's inductive proof that a Hamiltonian path exists through any stack $S$ (theorem 1 in \cite{lucas1987rotation}): {\em given a $d$-extreme codeword $w_s$ in a $d$-dimensional stack, there exists a Hamiltonian path through the stack starting at $w_s$ and ending on a $d$-extreme codeword $w_t$}. The base case is $d=1$, where there are exactly $h$ codewords in $S$ that, when arranged in order of $w[1]$, have adjacent pairs differ by exactly one edge flip (a path in $K_n$), with $1$-extreme codewords at the beginning and end with $w_s[1] = 0$, $w_t[1] = h-1$.  Now consider a stack $S$ with $d > 1$.  Partition $S$ into $h$ {\bf substacks} $\{S(i) = \{w \in S | w[d] = i\} \}_{i=0}^{h-1}$, and arrange them in order by $i$.  Let $S(0)$ start on $w_s$, which is $d$-extreme, so it is also $d-1$-extreme, and so, by the inductive hypothesis, a Hamiltonian path exists through $S(0)$ ending on a $d-1$-extreme node $w_{t0}$.  One can show that $w_{t0}$ connects to an extreme codeword $w_{s1}$ in $S(1)$ \cite{lucas1987rotation}.  Start at $w_{s1}$ in $S(1)$ and repeat this process to chain together Hamiltonian paths through all of the substacks, ending on $w_t$ in $S(h-1)$, which is a Hamiltonian path through all of $S$.  Moreover, since $w_s$ and $w_t$ are $d-1$-extreme,  and $w_s[d] = 0$ and $w_t[d] = h-1$, they are $d$-extreme $\square$.

This theorem can be used inductively to assemble an $n-1$ dimensional stack of height $2$ in Hamiltonian order, which contains all vertices of $K_n$.  Figure~\ref{fig:algorithm} shows a complete implementation in 16 lines of pure python, which is slightly simpler than Lucas's provided code.  The key trick is to reverse adjacent stacks of the same dimension to ensure that the $d-1$-extreme codewords that connect their boundaries are the ones that differ by exactly one flip.  Figure~\ref{fig:stacks} provides more intuition via several example stacks.  We also provide a Javascript web app using d3 \cite{bostock2011d3} to animate the Hamiltonian path one step at a time.
